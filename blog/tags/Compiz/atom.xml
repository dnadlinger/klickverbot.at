   <content type="html">On my laptop I&apos;m currently running Kubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron). For additional eye candy goodness I am using the [@compiz-fusion@] package from the Kubuntu repositories. Surprisingly, even on the laptop hardware (Asus V1S) everything went smooth out of the box â€“ I could even manage to find some drivers for the webcam and for the finger print scanner.

Well, everything worked fine except for one little detail: When I had an active Konsole session on one cube face, for example a log file, and continued to work on another side of the cube, the Konsole output would often be broken when I switched back to it. It would look as if the output had been scrolled, but the non-scrolled output hadn&apos;t been cleared from the window. This problem could be fixed by forcing the window to refresh, e.g. by switching to another (Konsole) tab.

In their 169.XX driver series, nVidia added a config option called [@UseCompositeWrapper@], which can help to sort out this kind of redraw problems. Fortunately, enabling this via adding the following line to the [@Device@] section of my [@xorg.conf@] was enough to solve the problem:
