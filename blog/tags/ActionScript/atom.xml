   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;… but unfortunately not in a personal project of mine that I started quite a while ago and which I have resumed work on recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I have been finally able to fix a bug which had already taken me some hours to trace down. Basically, mouse-over and -off events would not work properly on certain &lt;code&gt;MovieClip&lt;/code&gt;s. After some digging through my custom code managing these events (which I needed to come up with because there is no way to let hover events bubble up the display hierarchy in ActionScript 2), I found that &lt;code&gt;hitTest()&lt;/code&gt; wouldn&amp;#8217;t work properly on these clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the fun part began. I meticulously checked every aspect of the &lt;code&gt;MovieClip&lt;/code&gt;s for anything special, I even considered that it might have something to do with the fact that they were positioned right behind some &lt;code&gt;TextField&lt;/code&gt;s, which could have triggered some Flash player bugs (given that they are already surrounded by a cloud of weirdness in AS2). Nope, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#8217;t until I had already pretty much given up that I noticed that the name of the clips in question contained a period. After I removed it … &lt;code&gt;hitTest()&lt;/code&gt; worked fine – thanks a lot for wasting my time, Adobe! Not only that this really should not happen, at least not without a runtime warning, the fact that you cannot use periods in &lt;code&gt;MovieClip&lt;/code&gt; names is apparently undocumented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well…&lt;/p&gt;</content>
