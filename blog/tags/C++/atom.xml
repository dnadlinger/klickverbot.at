   <title>STL Algorithms</title>

   <content type="html">While attending a workshop at &lt;a href=&quot;http://linz.linuxwochen.at&quot;&gt;Linuxwochen Linz&lt;/a&gt; recently, I found using [@std::for_each@] and other algorithms from the C++ Standard Template library without even really thinking about it, much to the surprise of the other workshop attendants, which were, contrary to me, rather artists than coders. As I were thinking about the way my C++ coding style evolved over the years, I remembered that my use of [@&lt;algorithm&gt;@]s can be traced back to a single article on Dr. Dobb&apos;s: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/184401446&quot;&gt;STL Algorithms vs. Hand-Written Loops&lt;/a&gt;.

The text was written by Scott Meyers almost ten years ago, but in my eyes, it is still a very good read on the topic. Highly recommended!

   <title>Debugging KDE applications with gdb</title>

   <content type="html">A pretty long time has passed since my last post here, and in the meantime I have jumped right into KDE development myself. I have stumbled upon quite a few tricks and pitfalls that I will undoubtedly write about here some day.

For now, I just want to share a little gem which I have discovered a few minutes ago: In [@kdesdk/scripts@], David Faure published a little script called [@kde-devel-gdb@] (&quot;view with WebSVN&quot;:http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdesdk/scripts/kde-devel-gdb?view=markup), which extends gdb with the ability to print the contents of several Qt containers, including the widely used [@QString@]. Highly recommended!
