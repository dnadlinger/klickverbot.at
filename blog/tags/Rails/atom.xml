   <title>Getting started with git</title>

   <content type="html">Recently, I decided to have a look at the revision control system &quot;Git&quot;:http://git-scm.com and the »social code hosting service« &quot;GitHub&quot;:http://github.com, which is currently hyped in large parts of the open source community (git is used for the Linux kernel, Ruby on Rails, ...). At first, I felt pretty overwhelmed, because the differences to other SCMs like Subversion were bigger than I had expected. But now, having read the excellent blog post &quot;Got git?&quot;:http://b.lesseverything.com/2008/3/25/got-git-howto-git-and-github by Steven Bristol, I am starting to understand the concepts and the motivation behind it.

Frankly, I am still not quite sure if the &quot;doing it distributed&quot; paradigm will really establish itself in everyday coding work, but for open source projects git looks very promising at least.

   <title>Distributing Rails Applications</title>

   <content type="html">I just found &quot;this little tutorial&quot;:http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/distributingrubyapplications/rails.html on how to package your Rails application into a neat archive for showing it to your customers.

I guess it will come in quite handy for me in a few weeks because I am developing a small application for a friend of mine at the moment, who is not a developer, but wants to run the application locally on his Windows box.
