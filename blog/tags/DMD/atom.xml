   <title>Random D development news</title>
   <link href="http://klickverbot.at/blog/2011/04/random-d-development-news/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://klickverbot.at/blog/2011/04/random-d-development-news</id>
   <content type="html">During the last couple of weeks, I didn&apos;t really find time to update this blog. Nevertheless, however, I was able to spare some time for work on a couple open source projects related to the &quot;D programming language&quot;:http://d-programming-language.org. But first, let me quickly summarize some great changes that will be in the next DMD release:

Don Clugston has basically &quot;re-implemented CTFE&quot;:https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/pull/23 to fix a whole slew of compile-time function execution bugs, among which is the dreaded &quot;bug 1330&quot;:http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1330. There are still some regressions compared to DMD 2.052 (like &quot;this one&quot;:http://lists.puremagic.com/pipermail/dmd-internals/2011-April/001448.html, which breaks QtD), but apart from those, it&apos;s a big step towards getting CTFE out of the »experimental feature« category. The new architecture will also make implementing reference types easier, but this is still a long way off. Then next DMD/Phobos release will also include the new &quot;std.parallelism&quot;:http://cis.jhu.edu/~dsimcha/d/phobos/std_parallelism.html module by David Simcha, some GC optimizations and a large amount of other improvements (among which is the addition of the &quot;parent trait&quot;:https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd/commit/2e261cd640e5266c569ad224ffbfe229a0315d97, so that QtD doesn&apos;t need a patched DMD any longer) – due to the GitHub migration and the larger part of x86_64 support being done, the perceived development speed in the core community really went up a notch.

As for my own (insignificant, compared to the above) contributions, I did some work on &quot;LDC&quot;:http://dsource.org/projects/ldc during the last few days, porting it to &quot;LLVM 2.9&quot;:http://llvm.org/ and bringing the front-end in sync with &quot;DMD 1.067&quot;:http://digitalmars.com/d/1.0/changelog.html – you can find the changes in the default branch over at &quot;Bitbucket&quot;:https://bitbucket.org/lindquist/ldc. The DMD updates also contained some changes to the varargs ABI on x86_64 and other areas of the runtime interface, which I didn&apos;t merge yet, because it would require an update to Tango as well. I am not aware of any regressions so far (see the &quot;DStress results&quot;:/code/ldc/), but feel free to ping me in case of any problems.

There were also some updates and bug fixes to D support in &quot;SWIG&quot;:http://swig.org, most notably support for the &quot;nspace feature&quot;:http://swig.org/Doc2.0/D.html#D_nspace, which allows you to map C++ namespaces to D packages/modules (it doesn&apos;t work for free functions and global variables yet, but this is a general SWIG restriction that could be easily lifted, just ask me if you need it). There was another SWIG release in the meantime, version 2.0.3, but it was only a »quick backup« by the maintainer before he merged some intrusive Python changes. I was caught pretty much off-guard by it and had no time for real testing and thus, it contains some bugs (mainly related to nspace support when split-proxy mode is not activated, thanks to Jonathan Pfau for the reports) – please use SVN trunk instead.

Another little project I recently worked on is &quot;std.units&quot;:/code/units/, an units of measurement implementation for D. This topic came up several times on the NG previously, and every time it was suggested to add units support with Phobos, so I have merged the work into my Phobos fork. Please note, however, that this is in no way a formal review request yet. There are still a couple of items left on my to-do list, but before I am tackling the remaining issues, I&apos;d greatly appreciate some feedback (see the thread on the D newsgroup, &quot;RFC: Units of measurement for D (Phobos?)&quot;:http://www.digitalmars.com/webnews/newsgroups.php?art_group=digitalmars.D&amp;article_id=134590).

Finally, a personal note: Yesterday, I received notice that I was accepted to work on my &quot;Apache Thrift project&quot;:/code/gsoc/thrift under the umbrella of Digital Mars as part of the &quot;Google Summer of Code 2011&quot;:http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011 – thanks a lot to everybody who supported my proposals for their trust in me! I know that the expectations are high, and will do my very best to live up to them.

   <title>The Joys of OPTLINK</title>
   <link href="http://klickverbot.at/blog/2010/02/the-joys-of-optlink/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://klickverbot.at/blog/2010/02/the-joys-of-optlink</id>
   <content type="html">As you might know, DMD/Windows (the reference compiler for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/&quot;&gt;D&lt;/a&gt; programming language) does not use the standard COFF format for the object files it generates, but the fairly obscure OMF instead. This fact itself causes quite a number of annoyances. For example, the format differences make it unable to link static libraries produced by other compilers to D projects, which is especially annoying since it also applies to DLL import libraries. You also cannot use any tools which expect object files in COFF format and vice versa.

However, all of these issues, as annoying as they may be, do not pose a serious problem, they can all be worked around. But there is another one, and it has seven letters: OPTLINK. OPTLINK, courtesy of Digital Mars, is the linker which comes with DMD. There are quite a number of issues with it:

First, it is proprietary closed-source software. Apart from some people&apos;s idealistic worries, this also poses a serious problem to more pragmatically inclined coders because _there are no alternative linkers_ for OMF, at least no even half-decent ones. This means that if you stumble upon a bug, you can do nothing more than to wait for Walter Bright to fix it.

Second, even if the source code was available, it would probably still be hard to fix bugs, since, according to Walter himself, large parts are written in assembler – a _maintainer&apos;s nightmare_. This might also explain why it took him so long to fix some serious bugs in the past…

Third, there are bugs. _Lots of bugs_, compared to other linkers and with the pretty high version number (8.00.2) in mind. If you want to know what I am talking about, just search the D newsgroups; projects which make extensive use of templates seem to be affected more often than others. Until yesterday, I personally had been spared from this kind of issues, but the OPTLINK bug I encountered yesterday almost drove me crazy, because one wouldn&apos;t expect this at all: &lt;!--more--&gt;

After I had worked quite some time on Linux exclusively, I needed to compile a Windows version of a project of mine. So I went ahead and rebooted, updated DMD, Tango and a few other tools. Everything worked fine, the project even built fine, until I needed to build debug symbols into the binary. Every time I just added the [@-g@] flag to the compiler invocation, OPTLINK would abort with »Error 118: Filename Expected«. Because I had also upgraded my build tool, my first thought was that the linker commands could really be broken, but on closer inspection, it turned out that the invocation was generated perfectly fine. So I went on and downgraded all of the tools again, but to no avail – again the same error, although debug builds had worked flawlessly in the past.

After having searched for about an hour, I finally found the cause, and I could not really believe it at first: Compared to my previous D/Windows setup, I had added the Notepad++ installation directory to my [@PATH@]. You might ask yourself now, »Um, what? How should that break the linker?« Well, it turned out that OPTLINK apparently has problems with handling plus signs in all the lookup paths it uses, including not only the ones passed at the command line, but also those from the environment variables.

For a second I was really tempted to just drop DMD altogether, but unfortunately, there currently is no other D compiler of comparable quality for Windows. In my eyes, it would really help if DMD used COFF for its object files, making it possible to easily switch out OPTLINK, since the maturity of the tool-chain is currently the number one problem of D.

   <title>Installing DMD, LDC, Tango and DSSS on (K)Ubuntu Jaunty</title>
   <link href="http://klickverbot.at/blog/2009/07/installing-dmd-ldc-tango-and-dsss-on-kubuntu-jaunty/"/>
   <updated>2009-07-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://klickverbot.at/blog/2009/07/installing-dmd-ldc-tango-and-dsss-on-kubuntu-jaunty</id>
   <content type="html">For quite a while now, I am using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;D programming language&lt;/a&gt;, version 1 (I have not looked at D2 yet, it is said to be still rather unstable). Even though I like it very much for its syntactical quality and the language itself is reasonably mature, I must admit that setting up the toolchain correctly can still be a very cumbersome task to do, especially when you are new to D.

This post describes an installation routine that should provide you with a working D development environment containing DMD, LDC, Tango and DSSS on (K)Ubuntu Jaunty. Please note that it assumes your system to be »clean« – if you have already installed any D-related software, it is probably advisable to remove it completely to prevent any problems with, for instance, stale files. &lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;figure class=&apos;code&apos;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mkdir -p ~/tmp
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/tmp

wget http://ftp.digitalmars.com/dmd.1.050.zip
unzip dmd.1.050.zip
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;dmd/linux/bin/
chmod +x dmd dumpobj obj2asm rdmd
sudo cp dmd dmd.conf dumpobj obj2asm rdmd /usr/local/bin/

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/tmp
svn co http://svn.dsource.org/projects/tango/trunk tango

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;tango/
sudo &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;dmd build/build.sh --lib-install-dir /usr/local/lib
sudo cp -rf user/object.di user/rt user/std user/tango /usr/local/include/d/

sudo su -c &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;echo -e &amp;quot;[Environment]\nDFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/d -defaultlib=tango-base-dmd -debuglib=tango-base-dmd -L-ltango-user-dmd -version=Tango -version=Posix&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /usr/local/bin/dmd.conf&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

sudo su -c &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;echo -e &amp;quot;# dsss\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/d-language-packagers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
sudo apt-get install dsss
sudo su -c &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;echo &amp;quot;profile=dmd-posix-tango&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /etc/drebuild/default&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

You should now be able to build your D/Tango programs with DMD and DSSS.

I would suggest giving &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dsource.org/projects/ldc&quot;&gt;LDC&lt;/a&gt; at least a short glance, a fairly young compiler project which leverages &lt;a href=&quot;http://llvm.org/&quot;&gt;LLVM&lt;/a&gt; as its code generating backend. It is maturing very quickly and allows you to make use of the various features the LLVM compiler infrastructure provides, the most noticeable probably being its excellent optimization routines. Fortunately, there are current binary packages available at launchpad, so all that is needed to LDC is:


&lt;figure class=&apos;code&apos;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo su -c &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;echo -e &amp;quot;# ldc-daily\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/d-language-packagers/ppa/ubuntu karmic main\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu karmic main universe&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ldc-daily libtango-ldc-daily-dev

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/tmp
wget -O ldc-posix-tango http://www.dsource.org/projects/ldc/browser/ldc-posix-tango?format&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;raw
sudo su -c &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;sed &amp;quot;s:ldc.rebuild.conf:/etc/ldc/ldc.rebuild.conf:&amp;quot;  /etc/drebuild/ldc-posix-tango&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

sudo su -c &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;echo &amp;quot;profile=ldc-posix-tango&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /etc/drebuild/default&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Note that the above commands install a daily snapshot of LDC, which I would recommend to use due to the currently fast development of LDC. In order not to break you Jaunty installation, please _*do not forget* to comment out the official »karmic« repositories_ (which contain some dependencies for [@ldc-daily@]) in your [@/etc/apt/sources.list@] and run [@apt-get update@] after the installation is completed.

Both compilers are set up to use Tango, do _not_ install Tango via DSSS! If you want to switch compilers, just activate the corresponding profile in [@/etc/drebuild/default@] and do not forget to rebuild any D libraries you might have compiled and installed with the old compiler (just run [@dsss net install … @]for the ones you installed using DSSS).

p(update). Since I wrote this post, Tango received yet another big structural change to its codebase (amongst other changes, the core and user libraries have been merged). Now, you should use the supplied _»bob«_ tool now to build tango. Additionally, Karmic is now stable so you might have to adapt the APT repository-related instructions.
