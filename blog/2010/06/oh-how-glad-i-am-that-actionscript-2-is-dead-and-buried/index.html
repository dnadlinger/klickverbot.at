Basically, mouse-over and -off events would not work properly on certain <code>MovieClip</code>s. After some digging through my custom code managing these events (which I needed to come up with because there is no way to let hover events bubble up the display hierarchy in ActionScript 2), I found that <code>hitTest()</code> wouldn&#8217;t work properly on these clips.</p> <p>Now the fun part began. I meticulously checked every aspect of the <code>MovieClip</code>s for anything special, I even considered that it might have something to do with the fact that they were positioned right behind some <code>TextField</code>s, which could have triggered some Flash player bugs (given that they are already surrounded by a cloud of weirdness in AS2). Nope, nothing.</p> <p>It wasn&#8217;t until I had already pretty much given up that I noticed that the name of the clips in question contained a period. After I removed it … <code>hitTest()</code> worked fine – thanks a lot for wasting my time, Adobe! Not only that this really should not happen, at least not without a runtime warning, the fact that you cannot use periods in <code>MovieClip</code> names is apparently undocumented.</p> <p>Oh well…</p> <footer> Like what you read? <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=@dnadlinger:">Let me know</a> what you think or <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=Just read »Oh, how glad I am that ActionScript 2 is dead and buried…« by @dnadlinger: http://klickverbot.at/blog/2010/06/oh-how-glad-i-am-that-actionscript-2-is-dead-and-buried/">share the article</a> on Twitter. </footer> </div> </article> </div> <footer id=main_footer> <ul> <li><a class=twitter href="//twitter.com/dnadlinger">Follow me on Twitter</a></li> <li><a class=mail href="/about">Contact me</a></li> <li><a class=rss href="/blog/atom.xml">Blog feed</a></li> </ul> </footer> </body> </html>
