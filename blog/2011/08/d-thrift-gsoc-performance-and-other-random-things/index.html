So, on to the meat of the recent changes (besides the usual little cleanup commits here and there):</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Async client design</em>: Yes, even though it took me quite some time to come up with the original one, I had completely missed the fact that it would be unreasonably difficult to extend the support code with resource types other than sockets – long story short, <code>TAsyncSocketManager</code> now inherits from <code>TAsyncManager</code>, instead of being a part of it. Also, I split <code>TFuture</code> into two parts, a <code>TFuture</code> interface for accessing the result, and a <code>TPromise</code> implementation for actually setting/storing it, and only the <code>TFuture</code> part is returned from the async client methods. The <a href="/code/gsoc/thrift/docs/thrift.async.base.html">thrift.async docs</a> are actually useful now.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Async socket timeouts</em>: Correctly handling the state of the connection after a <code>read</code>/<code>write</code> timeout turned out to be a surprisingly tough problem to solve (allowing other request to be executed on the same connection after a timeout could lead to strange results). In the end, I settled for just closing the connection, which is a simple yet effective solution. To correctly implement this, I also had to finally kill the <code>TTransport.isOpen</code> related contracts and replace them with exceptions in the right places, leading to modified/clarified <em><code>isOpen</code> semantics</em>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <em>non-blocking server</em> now handles one-way calls correctly, and modifying the task pool after it is running no longer leads to undefined results. In the process, I have also turned the static <code>event</code> struct allocations into dynamic ones, since this should have no measurable performance impact, but removes the dependence on the (unstable, per the <code>libevent</code> docs) struct layout.</p> </li> <li> <p>D now also has a <code>TPipedTransport</code>, which forwards a copy of all data read/written to another transport, useful e.g. for logging requests/responses to disk.</p> </li> <li> <p>The biggest chunk of time was actually spent on <em>performance investigations</em>: While I was pretty certain that the D serialization code should not perform any worse than its C++ counterpart already, the difference in speed merely being compiler-dependent, I wanted to prove this fact so that I could cross this item from the list. This involved updating <a href="http://dsource.org/projects/ldc">LDC</a> to the 2.054 frontend (only to discover that Alexey Prokhin decided to start work on it at the same time I did, the related commits in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lindquist/ldc">main repository</a> are his now), fixing some LDC-specific druntime bugs, etc<sup class=footnote id=fnr1><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. Unfortunately, I couldn’t test GDC because of <a href="http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=6411">issue 6411</a>, but without further ado, here are the results:</p> </li> </ul> <figure> <table class=firstname> <thead> <tr> <th>&nbsp;</th> <th>Writing / kHz</th> <th>Reading / kHz</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr class=odd> <td>DMD v2.054, -O -release -inline</td> <td>2&thinsp;051</td> <td>1&thinsp;030</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GCC 4.6.1 (C++), -O2, templates</td> <td>5&thinsp;667</td> <td>1&thinsp;050</td> </tr> <tr class=odd> <td>LDC, -O3 -release</td> <td>2&thinsp;300</td> <td>1&thinsp;077</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LDC, -output-ll / opt -O3</td> <td>5&thinsp;500</td> <td>3&thinsp;150</td> </tr> <tr class=odd> <td>LDC, -output-ll / opt -std-compile-opts</td> <td>6&thinsp;700</td> <td>1&thinsp;950</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </figure> <p>At this point, I will disregard my earlier resolution and again get into the nitty-gritty details – the rest of this post can easily be summarized as <em>the D version is indeed up to par with C++, when it is equally well optimized</em>, but if you are curious about the details, read on.</p> <p>If you read the performance figures from my last post, the first thing you will probably notice is that the C++ reading performance figure is about four times lower now. This isn’t a mistake; noting the comparatively slim advantage of the C++ version, I made a <a href="https://github.com/dnadlinger/thrift/commit/e7ab6c3b14b31c0241a1d37e674d3fefcbb53276">change</a> to it quite some time ago, which avoids allocating a new <code>TMemoryBuffer</code> instance on every loop iteration (the D version also reuses it). Without really considering the implications, though, I also moved the construction of the <code>OneOfEach</code> struct out of the loop. This seemed like a minor detail to me, but in fact, it enabled reuse of the <code>std::string</code>-internal buffers for the string members of the struct, which is unrealistic (e.g. for a pretty similar situation in the non-blocking server, there is no buffer reuse possible as well).</p> <p>In a situation where a big part of the time is spent actually allocating and copying around memory, this makes a big difference. To test this assumption about the big influence of memory allocations, I compiled a version of the D benchmark where a static buffer for the strings was used instead of reallocating them every time, and indeed, the reading performance was more than twice as high.</p> <p>The <code>std::string</code> implementation of the GCC STL seems to be fairly inefficient in this case, because the best D result (which uses GC-allocated memory), is almost three times faster than it for the reading part. It is possible that there are some further optimizations which could improve performance (<code>-O3</code> didn’t change things for the better, in case you are wondering), but as my goal wasn’t to squeeze every last bit of performance out of this synthetic benchmark, I didn’t investigate this issue any further.</p> <p>But now to the D results: Simply switching to LDC 2 instead of DMD didn’t give any great speedups, because <code>readAll()</code> wasn’t inlined by it either, thus leaving all the memory copying unoptimized, as discussed in the last post. To see how much of a difference this would really make, I compiled the D code to LLVM IR files and manually ran the optimizer/code generator/linker on them, with the plan being to manually add the <code>alwaysinline</code> attribute to the relevant pieces of IR:</p> <figure><pre><code>ldc2 -c -output-ll -oq -w -release -I../src -Igen-d ….d
llvm-link *.ll -o benchmark.bc
opt {-O3, -std-compile-opts} benchmark.bc -o benchmark_opt.bc
llvm-ld -native -llphobos2 -ldl -lm -lrt benchmark_opt.bc
</code></pre></figure> <p>I then discovered that the method calls in question were properly inlined by the stand-alone <code>opt</code> without any manual intervention anyway. I am not really sure why this happens; the inliner cost limits could be more liberal in this case, or the optimization passes being scheduled in a different way than inside LDC could have an impact, or maybe it’s connected to the fact that <code>TMemoryBuffer</code> and the caller are in different modules (to my understanding, LTO <em>shouldn’t</em> be required to optimize in this case, but it may well be that I am mistaken here).</p> <p>The <code>LDC -output-ll</code> rows in the above table correspond to the benchmark compiled this way, with the <code>-std-compile-opts</code> and <code>-O3</code> flags passed to <code>opt</code>, respectively. This is a nice example of how important compiler optimizations for this, again, synthetic benchmark really are: for the reading part of the benchmark, <code>-O3</code> gives a nice speed boost because of the more aggressive inlining (<code>-std-compile-opts</code> doesn’t touch <code>TBinaryProtocol.readFieldBegin()</code>, which is called 15 times per loop iteration and contains some code that can completely be optimized out), but for the writing part, its result is actually <em>slower</em>, presumably because of locality effects (the call graphs are identical).</p> <p>The only change related to benchmark performance I made since the last post was an LDC-specific workaround to stop manifest constants from incorrectly being leaked from the CTFE codegen process into the writing functions. I think the above results are justification enough to stop worrying about raw serialization performance – the results when using the Compact instead of the Binary protocol are similar – and moving on to more important topics<sup class=footnote id=fnr2><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.</p> <p class=footnote id=fn1><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> <s>If you are curious about LDC 2, you can get the source I used from the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lindquist/ldc">official hg repo</a>, and the LDC-specific <a href="https://github.com/dnadlinger/druntime/tree/ldc2">druntime</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dnadlinger/phobos/tree/ldc2">Phobos</a> source from my clones at GitHub</s>.
