The former is a naive implementation of a threaded server which just spawns a new worker thread per client connection, while the latter uses a <code>std.parallelism</code> thread pool to process the queued client connections (the maximum number of active connections is configurable). I also added a D version of the <code>StressTest</code> server for sanity checking.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another server-related change is the addition of server and processor <em>event handlers</em>, which can be used to hook custom code into various points during the server/request lifecycle, e.g. for collecting diagnostic data. Data can be persisted between the calls by saving them as connection/call »context«, which is a <code>Variant</code> the server code passes around for you (I went with variants over e.g. templating the server code on the context object type simply to avoid adding another layer of complexity for a non-essential feature).</p> </li> <li> <p>I added a standalone test case exercising the different transport types (socket, file, memory buffer) combined with the various wrapper transports (buffered, framed), modeled after the C++ <code>TransportTest</code>. This has uncovered a number of (sometimes not-so-) subtle defects in the transport implementations which have been fixed (TSocket not handling <code>EINTR</code>, framed/memory buffer <code>borrow()</code> would also return smaller than requested, <code>TFileReaderTransport</code> not tailing files correctly, …).</p> </li> <li> <p>Build system improvements: The stand-alone test cases are now organized in a much less cumbersome scheme, and DDoc documentation is generated for the library by default. <code>lib/d/README</code> now has instructions on how to generate a self-signed certificate for SSL socket testing.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you are on OS X, you might want to manually apply <a href="https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/phobos/pull/131">Phobos pull request 131</a> until it is merged into Git master to avoid your servers crashing due to an unhandled <code>SIGPIPE</code> (you can also just set <code>signal(SIGPIPE, …)</code> to <code>SIG_IGN</code> in your startup code).</p> <p>I have also added a list of not yet scheduled ideas to the <a href="/code/gsoc/thrift/">project page</a>. Implementing a ZLib compression transport is currently the top item on my list, after which I will start to work on a non-blocking server implementation as planned. An asynchronous version of <code>TClient</code> is something I certainly want to implement, but I am planning to defer work on it until I have tackled the non-blocking server, as I could end up using the same approach (e.g. <code>libevent</code>) for it.</p> <footer> Like what you read? <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=@dnadlinger:">Let me know</a> what you think or <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=Just read »D/Thrift: Docs, Servers, Tests« by @dnadlinger: http://klickverbot.at/blog/2011/07/d-thrift-gsoc-docs-servers-tests/">share the article</a> on Twitter.
