My name is David Nadlinger, statistically speaking my life is around 25&nbsp;% complete, and when I'm not pondering quantum physics, you'll usually find me writing software or dabbling in music and design.</p> <p>Originally from Linz, Austria, I am currently a DPhil student in the <a href="https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/ion-trap-quantum-computing-group">University of Oxford</a>. My research is on trapped ion quantum information – how to build a quantum computer out of single atoms –, a field I first came in touch with during my Physics degree at <a href="http://www.tiqi.ethz.ch/">ETH Zürich</a>. I am also interested in <a href="/code">computer science and programming language design</a>, which has been a favorite pastime (and superb time sink) during the last few years.</p> <p>Perhaps as a counter-balance to my otherwise rather analytical nature, I like to pursue the creative side of things whenever I can find some spare time (ah, academia…). Music has been very important to me for a long time – after receiving classical piano training (which I now wish I had taken more seriously), my interests later shifted more towards Jazz and improvisation. Recently, I have also been seen on various dancefloors, some more competitive than others.</p> <p>I also like experimenting in graphics design whenever I get the chance to – what particularly appeals to me are typography-heavy designs in print and web, and kinetic type in motion graphics. For inspiration, I enjoy browsing <a href="http://typographica.org/">well-done</a> <a href="http://typophile.com/">fonts</a> and <a href="http://fontsinuse.com">typography</a>, and <a href="http://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a> is always worth a look.</p> <h2 id=contact>Contact</h2> <p>The best way to contact me is probably via mail at <a href="mailto:da...@klickverbot.at">da…@klickverbot.at</a> (as a measure against address harvesting, please replace the dots with the three last characters of my first name). I generally try to answer any requests within at least a day or two.</p> <p>Besides that, you will usually find me going by the moniker <em>klickverbot</em> on various online services – e.g. on <a href="http://twitter.com/klickverbot">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dnadlinger">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klickverbot">Bitbucket</a>, or the <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> IRC network (I’ll often be idling in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/d">#d</a>).</p> <h2 id=colophon>Colophon</h2> <p>This hand-crafted website was generated using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, makes liberal use of <a href="http://html5.org/">HTML 5</a> and related techniques, and is best viewed using any modern browser. Its design is <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive</a> in nature and should work on just about any device (be sure to let me know if it doesn’t on yours). Fonts are <a href="http://www.droidfonts.com/info/droid-serif-fonts/">Droid Serif</a> and <a href="https://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/about-en.html">M+ 1m</a>, and the icons are displayed using a custom symbol font based on the adorable <a href="http://keyamoon.com/icomoon">IcoMoon</a> collection.</p> </div></div> </div> <footer id=main_footer> <ul> <li><a class=twitter href="//twitter.com/dnadlinger">Follow me on Twitter</a></li> <li><a class=mail href="/about">Contact me</a></li> <li><a class=rss href="/blog/atom.xml">Blog feed</a></li> </ul> </footer> </body> </html>
