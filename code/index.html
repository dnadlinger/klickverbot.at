This page features a woefully incomplete compilation of some of my projects.</p> <p>Originally, my motivation was mostly graphics programming and game development, but that has changed over the years – right now, my main interests are the dirty low-level magic of e.g. compiler writing on one hand and design of and algorithms for parallel and distributed computing on the other hand.</p> <p>I believe that going open source is a viable and beneficial approach both for personal/not-for-profit projects as well as for many corporate products. But perhaps just as important as that, having reams of real-world code to peruse at their disposal is also a fantastic resource for people new to programming – at least, it has been for me, and I have been contributing to free software whenever time allowed ever since.</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Apache Thrift:</em> Having been offered the chance to participate in the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/program/home/google/gsoc2011">Google Summer of Code 2011</a> program under the umbrella of <a href="http://digitalmars.com">Digital Mars</a>, I implemented <a href="/code/gsoc/thrift">D support</a> for <a href="http://thrift.apache.org">Apache Thrift</a>, which is an open source serialization/RPC framework originally developed by Facebook. Feature-wise, the library can be considered to be on par with the established C++ and Java implementations, and it is currently <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-1500">pending upstream inclusion</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Assimp:</em> The <a href="http://assimp.sourceforge.net/">Open Asset Import Library</a> is a C/C++ library to load various 3D file formats, including Collada, 3DS, X, Obj, STL and others. Written by several members of the (German) <a href="http://zfx.info/">ZFX</a> 3D graphics/game development community, I contributed D bindings and help with maintenance and the CMake build system.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>D:</em> The statically typed, C-style syntax <a href="http://dlang.org">D programming language</a> pragmatically combines efficiency, control, and modeling power, with safety and programmer productivity. I discovered it when I started <a href="/code/d4">d4</a>, and have been involved with core language development for quite a while now – you will find my commits in the <a href="http://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd">reference compiler</a> as well as the <a href="http://github.com/D-Programming-Language/druntime">low-level runtime</a> and <a href="http://github.com/D-Programming-Language/phobos">standard libraries</a>. I also contributed two C library bindings to the <a href="http://github.com/D-Programming-Deimos">Deimos project</a> and a few fixes to the <a href="http://dlang.org">website</a>. An important meta-goal of mine is to help building a healthy and vibrant community.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>d4:</em> Along with a <a href="/science/3d-mathematics/">more or less scholarly paper</a> on the mathematical basics of realtime 3D rendering I wrote as part of my Matura exam (comparable to the British A levels), I designed and implemented <a href="/code/d4">a simple software rasterizer</a> in the D programming language. It is mainly for demonstration purposes, but I still find the metaprogramming-based vertex and pixel shader design quite interesting.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>KDE:</em> I originally joined the ranks of <a href="http://kde.org">KDE</a> committers to work on the stability of the then-new compositing support in KWin, KDE’s window manager (at that time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">Compiz</a> was all the craze, but didn’t integrate particularly well with KDE). After experiencing for the first time the amount of hair-pulling shipping a beta to several thousand people can entail, I contributed several small fixes to other projects.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>SWIG:</em> The <a href="http://swig.org/">Simple Wrapper Interface Generator</a> connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. I implemented comprehensive support for the D programming language (both versions 1 and 2), which first shipped with SWIG 2.0.2.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Generally, I am a fan of <a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a>, and you can find some more completed as well as some in-progress personal projects at my <a href="http://github.com/dnadlinger">GitHub account</a>. From time to time, I also submit patches to other project to address a specific issue that is bugging me, ranging e.g. from <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a> over <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> to <a href="http://winehq.org">Wine</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <footer id=main_footer> <ul> <li><a class=twitter href="//twitter.com/dnadlinger">Follow me on Twitter</a></li> <li><a class=mail href="/about">Contact me</a></li> <li><a class=rss href="/blog/atom.xml">Blog feed</a></li> </ul> </footer> </body> </html>
