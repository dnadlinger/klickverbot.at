<p class="lead">Hello, nice to meet you. My name is David Nadlinger, statistically speaking my life is around 25&nbsp;% complete, and when I'm not pondering quantum physics, you'll usually find me writing software or dabbling in music and design.</p>

Originally from Linz, Austria, I am currently a DPhil student in the [University of Oxford](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/ion-trap-quantum-computing-group). My research is on trapped ion quantum information -- how to build a quantum computer out of single atoms --, a field I first came in touch with during my Physics degree at [ETH Zürich](http://www.tiqi.ethz.ch/). I am also interested in [computer science and programming language design](/code), which has been a favorite pastime (and superb time sink) during the last few years.

Perhaps as a counter-balance to my otherwise rather analytical nature, I like to pursue the creative side of things whenever I can find some spare time (ah, academia…). Music has been very important to me for a long time -- after receiving classical piano training (which I now wish I had taken more seriously), my interests later shifted more towards Jazz and improvisation. Recently, I have also been seen on various dancefloors, some more competitive than others.

I also like experimenting in graphics design whenever I get the chance to – what particularly appeals to me are typography-heavy designs in print and web, and kinetic type in motion graphics. For inspiration, I enjoy browsing [well-done](http://typographica.org/) [fonts](http://typophile.com/) and [typography](http://fontsinuse.com), and [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) is always worth a look.


Contact
-------

The best way to contact me is probably via mail at [da...@klickverbot.at](mailto:da...@klickverbot.at) (as a measure against address harvesting, please replace the dots with the three last characters from my first name). I generally try to answer any requests at least within a day or two.

Besides that, you will usually find me going by the moniker _klickverbot_ on various online services – e.g. on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/klickverbot), [GitHub](https://github.com/klickverbot), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/klickverbot), or the [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) IRC network (I'll often be idling in [#d](irc://irc.freenode.net/d)).
