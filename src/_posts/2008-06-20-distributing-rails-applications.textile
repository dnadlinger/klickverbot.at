I just found "this little tutorial":http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/distributingrubyapplications/rails.html on how to package your Rails application into a handy archive for showing it to your customers.

I guess it will come in quite handy for me in a few weeks because I am developing a small application for a friend of mine at the moment, who is not a developer, but wants to run the application locally on his Windows box.
