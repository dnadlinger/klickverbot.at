Sorry if this notice might come a bit late for some of you, but a few days ago, I have committed a breaking change to "D support":/blog/2010/11/announcing-d-support-in-swig/ in "SWIG":http://swig.org trunk. It was needed to bring the names used in the D module in line with the C# one, the naming scheme of which was intended to be language-independent by the principal maintainer (although it is only used in the C# and D parts right now).

Most of the changes revolve around the term »wrap D module« being replaced with »intermediary D module«, including names derived from it. To adapt your interface files, just perform the following replacements:

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
s/cwtype/ctype/g
s/dwtype/imtype/g
s/dptype/dtype/g

s/$wcall/$imcall/g
s/$dpcall/$dcall/g

s/wrapdmodule/imdmodule/g
{% endcodeblock %}
