While coding my first Rails application in Eclipse using RadRails, I found that my HTML files were not encoded in the correct format. Although I knew that you _can_ specify the default file encoding (e.g. UTF-8) in Eclipse, it took me quite some time to find the corresponding option.

After looking for it for way too long (I guess it felt longer than it was, though), I finally found it in @Window > Preferences > General > Workspace@.
