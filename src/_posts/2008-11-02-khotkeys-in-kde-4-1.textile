I just upgraded to Kubuntu 8.10 in order to have a look at shiny new KDE 4. But amongst other minor annoyances, I had real trouble getting hotkeys to work. There are configuration options in the new System Settings panel (which is a huge regression compared to KControl by the way), but they seemed to have no effect.

After various attempts of fixing this problem myself, I finally found a (slightly hackish) solution: "Re: Does khotkeys work on your KDE 4.1?":http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5541572&postcount=9. Seems like KDE 4.1 is still _very_ beta...
